Tech Taste is an interactive web app built using React on the Front End, Java Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Tech Taste is a platform designed to connect strategists and technologists at Strategio to refer to for any food recommendations near them. 

Many technologists/strategists are either locals who love sharing about their favorite restaurants to frequent or are people who recently just relocated into one of Strategio’s clients’ hubs.  

Upon visiting the site you will be greeted with a login screen where you can either sign in or create an account with your strategio work email. 

Once you are logged in the screen will prompt you to either input a zip code or use your location in order to find restaurant recommendations. 

Then the screen will display the current uploaded restaurant recommendation along with the map showing their geographic locations in which a user is given the option to either like and save a restaurant to refer back to or they can add a new restaurant recommendation for all other users to view and save.
